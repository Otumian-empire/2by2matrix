operations on matrices such as multiplication of 2 matrices, multiplication of a matrix by some constant, and addition of matrices.

Let A = |a b|  and B = |e f| be 2 by 2 matrix
        |c d|          |g h|

multiplication of a matrix by a constant factor
A * k = |k*a k*b|
        |k*c k*d|

addition of matrices
A + B = |a+e b+f|
        |c+g d+h|

multiplication of matrices
A * B = |a*e + b*g  a*f + b*h|
        |c*e + d*g  c*f + d*h|

This programs I shall make use a multi-dimensional list/array - 2D
